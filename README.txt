Hi this is a remake of the willywonka mod on pmc(https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/willy-wonka-mod-heavy-work-in-progress/) that is mines btw but it was so bad and porly made in Mcreator that i decided to make a better version of it
this project and the older version was inspired by:https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2691473-willy-wonkas-marvelous-mod-0-0-2-1 by DrMeepster
